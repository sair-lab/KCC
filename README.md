# Kernel Cross-Correlator (KCC)

This repo contains source codes for the following paper, which is accepted by AAAI-18:

[Chen Wang](http://wangchen.online), [Le Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/zhangleuestc/home), [Lihua Xie](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/elhxie/), [Junsong Yuan](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/jsyuan/), Kernel Cross-Correlator, In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-18), Feb. 2018

There are two experiments in the paper, i.e. visual tracking, human activity recognition using wearable devices, which are contained in the independent folders, respectively.


You may find instructions to run the codes for visual tracking:
